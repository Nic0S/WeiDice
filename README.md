# WeiDice

A simple double-or-nothing gambling smart contract to learn the basics of Solidity development.

This is for educational purposes only and should only be used on testnets. Random number generation is not secure and very vulnerable to attack.

# Try it out

WeiDice is deployed on the Rinkeby testnet:
[0x70755Df8097Ac4718c7b72B78F7539A176096791](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x70755Df8097Ac4718c7b72B78F7539A176096791)

And you can use this painful frontend to interact with it: https://nic0s.github.io/WeiDice/web/weidice.html?contract=0x70755Df8097Ac4718c7b72B78F7539A176096791

**Make sure your MetaMask is pointing at the Rinkeby testnet before making any transactions.**
